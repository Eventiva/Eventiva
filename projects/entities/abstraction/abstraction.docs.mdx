A component for a Abstraction entity, supports serialization and de-serialization of Abstraction objects and can be used from
both backend and frontend.

## Get started

Install and use the entity to create a new instance:

```ts
// @ts-ignore
const abstraction = Abstraction.from({
  name: 'hello'
});
abstraction.name // 'hello'
```
