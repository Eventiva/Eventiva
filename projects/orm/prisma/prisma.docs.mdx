A plugable Prisma aspect. Used to maintain Prisma across the platform.

## Get started

Compose the aspect into your Harmony platform:

```ts
import { SymphonyPlatform } from '@bitdev/symphony.symphony-platform';

/**
 * compose the symphony platform.
 */    
export const MyPlatform = SymphonyPlatform({
  name: 'my-platform',

  aspects: [
    PrismaAspect,
  ]
});

export default MyPlatform;
```
