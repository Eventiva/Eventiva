A reusable development environment for NodeJS.
Use the NodeJS environment to create new NodeJS modules, entities and apps.

## Use in existing workspaces

Add the development env to your generator configuration on `workspace.jsonc`.

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": [
      "eventiva.envs/orm/prisma"
    ]
  }
}
```

You can see the generator templates in your workspace using `bit templates`.

## Use on an existing component

Use this dev environment on your existing components, by running the following command:

```
bit env set my-component eventiva.envs/orm/prisma
```


## Create a NodeJS workspace

You can create a new NodeJS workspace made from this env using the following command:

```
bit new node my-workspace --aspect eventiva.envs/orm/prisma
```

## Compose your own env

You can base on this env, and customize it to your needs. To create your env run this command:
```
bit create node-env my-new-env
```

Make sure your new environment class extends this env class and overrides the needed class methods.
