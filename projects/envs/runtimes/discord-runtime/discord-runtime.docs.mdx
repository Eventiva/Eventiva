A NodeJS runtime for Harmony. Use to allow for Aspects to include a runtime for building CLI apps and backends.

## Get started

Use the NodeJS Runtime in your Harmony platform:

```ts
import { DiscordRuntime } from '@bitdev/harmony.runtimes.discord-runtime';

export const WayneCom = HarmonyPlatform.from({
  name: 'wayne-com',

  main: [WaynePlatformAspect],

  runtimes: [
    new NodeJSRuntime()
  ],

  aspects: [
    [PeopleAspect, {
      authProvider: 'bit'
    }]
  ]
});
```

Create an aspect, or add a `*.node.runtime.ts` runtime to one of your existing aspects:

```
bit create aspect people
```

Run your platform:

```
bit run wayne-com
```

## ESBuild configuration

The NodeJS runtime is based on the Node Server app type which is based on ESBuild. To control its configuration use the first arugment when declearing the runtime:

```tsx
new NodeJSRuntime({
  esbuildOptions: {},
})
```
