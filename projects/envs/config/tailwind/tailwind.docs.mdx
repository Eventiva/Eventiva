This component is a basic Tailwind config for a Bit project. It is a preset that
can be used to quickly set up a Tailwind project by using the [Tailwind
transformer](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/styling/transformers/tailwind).

This config contains a preset for React projects, it gets all the TSX and JSX
files of the workspace and applies them to the config.

If you want to configure the preset you may want to modify the files patterns in it.

```ts
// preset.ts
import { globSync } from 'glob';

// example of a glob pattern to scan also .vue files
const content = globSync(['**/*.{vue,tsx,jsx}'], {
  ignore: ['**/node_modules/**'],
});
```
