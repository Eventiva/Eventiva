A general purpose GraphQL and REST API gateway for Harmony platforms.


## Use the gateway

The gateway is used by default by the Symphony platform aspect. You can use the default gateway for your needs by importing it from this package otherwise.

## Compose your gateway

You can compose your own gateway and register a Symphony platform to use by implementing the `Gateway` interface:

```ts
import type { Gateway } from '@bitdev/symphony.backends.gateway';

export class MyServer implements Gateway {
  name = 'my-gateway';
  
  run(context: BackendContext) {
    const app = express();

    // proxy requests here...

    app.listen(context.port, () => {
      console.log(`listening to port ${context.port}`);
    });
  }
};
```

You can learn on deployment options and other options in the Gateway API reference.
