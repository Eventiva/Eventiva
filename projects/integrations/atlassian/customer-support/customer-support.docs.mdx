## Get started

Compose the aspect into your Harmony platform:

```ts
import { PlatformAspect } from '@bitdev/harmony.aspects.platform-aspect';

/**
 * compose the wayne.com platform.
 */    
export const MyPlatform = HarmonyPlatform.from({
  name: 'my-platform',

  platform: PlatformAspect,

  runtimes: [
    new BrowserRuntime(),
    new NodeJSRuntime()
  ],

  aspects: [
    CustomerSupportAspect,
  ]
});

export default MyPlatform;
```
