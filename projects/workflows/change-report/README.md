Change Report GitHub Action
---

This action generates a report from the recent code changes and posts it to Slack or Discord.

### Demo
The report is created taking the commit messages in your repo as an input. Which means, the better you describe your work when committing stuff - the better this action will work for you üòâ. 

Here's how the generated change report might look:

```
