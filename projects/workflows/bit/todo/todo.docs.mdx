import { Image } from '@teambit/docs.ui.zoomable-image';
import uiScreenshot from './docs/ui_screenshot.png';

This aspect extracts the component's to-do comments from its source files, adds them as component metadata, and displays them in the terminal and in the UI.

This component demonstrates the following:

- How to create a custom aspect
- How to add component metadata during development, and persist it in the component snaps
- How to register a command
- How to register a route in the component UI
- How to add a tab to the component UI
- How to get basic info about the viewed component from the Component Context, in the UI
- How to fetch data from the workspace GraphQL

## Usage

Run the following to fork this aspect to your workspace:

```plaintext
bit fork learnbit.extending-bit/metadata/todos/todos-aspect
```

Run the following to install the aspect's peer dependencies:

```plaintext
bit install @apollo/client graphql --type peer
```

Run the following make this aspect loadable by your workspace (this will add the aspect to your `workspace.jsonc` file):

```plaintext
bit use learnbit.extending-bit/metadata/todos/todos-aspect
```

_ > Make sure to use the new aspect ID, after it's been forked!_

Run the following to try the aspect in your terminal (replace the component name in the example to a component that's available in your workspace):

```plaintext
bit todos module/demo
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```plaintext
demo.composition.tsx
  line 4  TODO  add a test for this composition

 ✖ 1 todo/fixme found

demo.docs.mdx
  line 8  TODO  add missing documentation

 ✖ 1 todo/fixme found

demo.ts
  line 3  TODO   remove unused variables
  line 6  FIXME  should return a number, not a string
```

Run your workspace UI (`bit start`) to see the same results displayed in a new 'To-dos' tab:

<Image src={uiScreenshot} maxWidth={800} hasBackground />
