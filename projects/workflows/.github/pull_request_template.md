<!-- Thank you for concidering to create a pull request for this project.

We utilise a bot to analyse the code quality of the pull request. Please make sure that the bot is happy with your changes before submitting the pull request.
As an additional benefit of this bot, we can automatically generate a description for your pull request based on the commit messages. 

We would still love you to explain what you have done in your own words, but if you are in a hurry, you can just submit the pull request without a description and the bot will generate one for you.
