=== 3. How your date contribute Beyond this server

We utilize a number of advanced tools to help keep all the components of our communities informed about the projects that we are working on.
This therefore means we need to share some data with third parties.

Space is linked bi-directionally with our Discord server.
This allows us to effectively respond to messages on both platforms, and receive key input from our stakeholders without forcing them to use either platform.

Our discord server can be found here: https://discord.com/invite/xxxxx

Our discord uses Answer Overflow to index content on the web.
By posting in any space channel which is linked with discord, your messages will be indexed on the web to help others find answers.
Your contributions benefit our community and become valuable resources for individuals seeking similar solutions online.

Your posts serve as building blocks for a collective knowledge base, aiding others who might encounter similar queries or challenges.
The information you share here transcends our immediate community, becoming accessible to a global audience seeking insights and solutions.

Each post you make isn't just a query or a discussion; it's a potential solution for someone searching the web for answers in the future.
Your active participation helps enrich this indexed knowledge repository and fosters a shared learning and support culture.

Remember that your contributions are valuable within our community and in the broader scope of the online information ecosystem.

Before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim (other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered Licence, we commit to extend to the person or entity ('you') accused of violating the Covered Licence the following provisions regarding cure and reinstatement, taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the term 'this Licence' refers to the specific Covered Licence being enforced.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the

have received notice of violation of this License (for any work)
from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
days after your receipt of the notice.
