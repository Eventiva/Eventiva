# Guide and User Agreement.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,

* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### 3. How your date contribute Beyond this server

We utilize a number of advanced tools to help keep all the components of our communities informed about the
projects that we are working on. This therefore means we need to share some data with third parties.

Space is linked bi-directionally with our Discord server. This allows us to effectively respond to messages on both
platforms, and receive key input from our stakeholders without forcing them to use either platform.

Our discord server can be found here: https://discord.com/invite/xxxxx

Our discord uses Answer Overflow to index content on the web. By posting in any space channel which is linked with
discord, your messages will be indexed on the web to help others find answers. Your contributions benefit our
community and become valuable resources for individuals seeking similar solutions online.

Your posts serve as building blocks for a collective knowledge base, aiding others who might encounter similar queries
or challenges. The information you share here transcends our immediate community, becoming accessible to a global
audience seeking insights and solutions.

Each post you make isn't just a query or a discussion; it's a potential solution for someone searching the web for
answers in the future. Your active participation helps enrich this indexed knowledge repository and fosters a shared
learning and support culture.

Remember that your contributions are valuable within our community and in the broader scope of the online information
ecosystem.

## GPL Cooperation Commitment

Before filing or continuing to prosecute any legal proceeding or claim
(other than a Defensive Action) arising from termination of a Covered
Licence, we commit to extend to the person or entity ('you') accused
of violating the Covered Licence the following provisions regarding
cure and reinstatement, taken from GPL version 3. As used here, the
term 'this Licence' refers to the specific Covered Licence being
enforced.

    However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
    license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
    provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
    and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
    copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
    reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you
    have received notice of violation of this License (for any work)
    from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
    days after your receipt of the notice.

We intend this Commitment to be irrevocable, and binding and
enforceable against us and assignees of or successors to our
copyrights.
