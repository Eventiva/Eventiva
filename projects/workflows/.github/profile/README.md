## Introduction

Eventiva is an platform for Event Planning and Production logistics. We have created a custom-built directory focused on indexing, marketing and connecting event specialist Vendors, Venues and professionals. We then connected this to our innovative tools for event production planning which include scheduling, itinerary, task management, contact management, warehousing ticket sales, interactive site maps, online and in-person sales solutions, accounting, payroll and human resources.

## How to get support 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

For **Features Requests**, **Q&A**, **Show & Tell** and **Discussions** please use **[our discussion page](https://github.com/Eventiva/Eventiva/discussions)** 🚑.

We have a **FAQ** label in our **[discussion page](https://github.com/Eventiva/Eventiva/discussions)** where you can get quick answers, help with debugging weird issues, and general help.

Our extensive **documentation** can be found at **[here](https://github.com/Eventiva/Eventiva)**.

### Why not GitHub Issues?

GitHub is our office, it's the place where our development and contributor teams do their work. We use the issue list to keep track of bugs and the features that we are working on. We do this openly for transparency, to reduce replication by contributors and increase productivity.

With the discussion page, you can leverage the knowledge of our wider community to get help with any problems you are having. Please keep in mind that this project is in early development, support is provided by the goodwill of our wonderful community members. Official specialist support channels will be established on full release.
