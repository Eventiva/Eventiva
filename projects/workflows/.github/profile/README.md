## Introduction

Welcome to the Eventiva repository. Eventiva is an open-source platform for Event Planning and Production logistics. We have created a custom-built directory focused on indexing, marketing and connecting event specialist Vendors, Venues and professionals. We then connected this to our innovative tools for event production planning which include scheduling, itinerary, task management, contact management, warehousing ticket sales, interactive site maps, online and in-person sales solutions, accounting, payroll and human resources.
